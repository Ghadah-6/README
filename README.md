# About Me

Hello! My name is Ghadah.

I am currently pursuing a degree in CS. My academic background includes coursework and experience in areas such as programming and problem-solving.

I am interested in Machine Learning because it allows computers to learn from data and make intelligent decisions. I am particularly interested in how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems such as data analysis, automation, and artificial intelligence.
